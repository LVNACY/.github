# Governance of LVNACY Open Source Projects

## Preamble

The purpose of open source projects in the LVANCY workspaces (with the
exception of the LVNACY website) are to provide resources for exploration and
organization for those interested in Art and Design, or to pursue an idea or
concept for the sake of learning and building. However, regardless of the
purpose of a project, the overall goal of open source projects in LVNACY is to
work together to bring a project to fruition. To this end, the following
guidelines will govern the project.

## Hierarchy

Overall design direction is provided by LVNACY. Beyond general direction, and
with regard to operations, projects carry a general hierarchy of
Users > Contributors > Maintainers.
Maintainers serve Contributors, working with writers, designers, artists, and
developers to build and/or improve the library, framework, reference, or
application. Contributors work with Maintainers to provide support for end
Users.

Accountability flows from the bottom up, 

## Consensus

Decisions are made via a consensus mechanism rather than majority vote. While the
process of consensus is generally slower, this process favors the value provided
by every member in a community. Furthermore, a number of community and
development benefits arise from consensus:
-   [Facilitation](#facilitation)
-   [Accountability](#accountability)
-   [Inclusivity](#inclusivity)
-   [Decentralization](#decentralization)

### Facilitation

Majority rule mechanisms tend to introduce hard and fast rules around how
a decision may be implemented. This can lead to secondary and tertiary
deleterious effects that may negatively impact the community as a whole.
a consensus-based decision-making process provides rails in which a community
may work together to implement agreed-upon additions or changes. As challenges
arise in the course of implementation, delegated individuals and groups can
rely on the support of the overall community to address them.

### Accountability

When the community works together to drive a project forward, accountability is
shared by the entire community, as opposed to a select few making decisions
on behalf of the community at large. With regard to the Users > Contributors >
Maintainers hierarchy, accountability moves from bottom to top, creating an
inclusive and flexibile development environment. While Maintainers are entrusted
to uphold community guidelines and manage community membership in the most
severest of cases, the whole community, generally, works together to ensure all
effective policies are enacted appropriately.

### Inclusivity

Consensus-based decision-making ensures every voice is heard, and all
decisions are, at minimum, approved by every participating member in a community.

### Decentralization

As an extension of inclusivity, consensus-based decision-making disperses power
dynamics across the entire community, rather than concentrating power in the
hands of a select few. As noted above, with regard to LVNACY projects, LVNACY
provides the direction of the project. However, operations and general
development are in the hands of the community:
- 	all members may present proposals to introduce or amend operational policies
- 	the community works together to revise proposals to arrive at consensus prior
	to adopting them
- 	the community resolves dissent in a meaningful and peaceful manner
- 	the community manages conflict through meaningful discourse rather than
	arbitration.

As stated above, Maintainers are entrusted to uphold community guidelines in the
most severest of cases; however, "the most severest of cases" are determined by
the community. At any time, any member may act in accordance with the Code of
Conduct to address issues that arise that do not require the community's input
or consensus.
